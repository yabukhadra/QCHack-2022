# qbraid-sdk-challenge



## Project Description
We modified the "Getting started with Amazon Braket" and "Enable account to access Braket QPUs" demos in order 
to create and measure outputs from a circuit that uses two EPR pairs (shared between wires 0 and 1, and 
2 and 3) and teleportation to create an EPR pair between wires 3 and 0.
